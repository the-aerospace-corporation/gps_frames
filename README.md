## Installation
This module can be installed using PyPI:
```
pip install gps-frames
```

## Running Tests
This module includes tests for all of the major functionality. To run the tests, you can use the commands in the makefile `make test`. Because some of the functions use JIT compilation via Numba, `make test-nojit` runs all of the tests without JIT compilation to enable better code coverage analysis.

## Using gps_frames
To motivating use case of this module is it determine distances between two points in space while accounting for non-inertial reference frames and non-simultaneous position measures. The basic functionality is demonstrated in `example.py`.ma

Note: When first run, gps-frames has significant overhead due to JIT compliation. This should only occur on the first run. Additionally, you may see `NumbaPerformanceWarning` messages related to the `@` (matrix multiplication) operator. These can be disregarded and should only appear the first time gps-frames is run.
